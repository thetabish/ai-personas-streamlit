# API Key Security Enhancement

## ✅ Changes Made

### **API Key Field Behavior**
- 🔒 **Always Empty on Refresh**: API key field starts empty every time the page is loaded/refreshed
- 🔄 **No Persistence**: API key is not saved between browser sessions
- 🛡️ **Enhanced Security**: Prevents accidental exposure of API keys in browser state

### **Key Modifications**

#### **1. Input Field Changes**
```python
# Before: Tried to persist API key from environment/session
value=current_api_key if current_api_key and not any(ph in current_api_key.lower() for ph in ["your_openrouter_api_key_here", "your_key_here", "example"]) else "",

# After: Always empty for security
value="",  # Always empty for security
```

#### **2. Enhanced Help Text**
- Added security notice in help section
- Added placeholder text showing expected format
- Clear explanation that API key is cleared on refresh

#### **3. Session State Management**
- API key stored in session state only during active session
- Automatically cleared when input field is empty
- No persistence across page refreshes

#### **4. Interview Start Logic**
- Uses current API key input as primary source
- Falls back to session state if needed
- Ensures API key is set in environment before starting interview

### **Security Benefits**

1. **🔒 No API Key Persistence**
   - API key never stored permanently in browser
   - Cleared automatically on page refresh
   - Reduces risk of accidental exposure

2. **🛡️ Enhanced User Awareness**
   - Clear security notices throughout the app
   - Users understand API key handling behavior
   - Informed consent for API key usage

3. **🔄 Clean Session Management**
   - API key only exists during active session
   - No leftover credentials in browser state
   - Fresh start with each page load

### **User Experience**

#### **What Users See:**
- 🔒 Security notice on main page
- 🔒 Security notice in sidebar
- ⚠️ Clear indication that API key will be cleared
- 📝 Helpful placeholder text in input field

#### **What Users Need to Do:**
- Enter API key fresh each time they use the app
- This is intentional for security reasons
- API key is only used for the current session

### **Technical Implementation**

```python
# API Key input - always empty
api_key_input = st.text_input(
    "OpenRouter API-Schlüssel eingeben:",
    value="",  # Always empty for security
    type="password",
    help="Ihr API-Schlüssel beginnt mit 'sk-or-v1-' (wird bei jedem Neuladen der Seite geleert)",
    placeholder="sk-or-v1-..."
)

# Clear session state when input is empty
if not api_key_input and 'api_key' in st.session_state:
    del st.session_state.api_key
```

## 🎯 Result

- **Enhanced Security**: API keys are never persisted
- **Better UX**: Clear communication about security behavior
- **Professional Standard**: Follows security best practices
- **User Awareness**: Users understand the security implications

The app now provides a secure, professional experience that prioritizes API key security while maintaining usability.
